# KLoops Github Organization

This directory contains the configuration of the KLoops Github organization.
To add or remove members and admins, make changes to this file.

This system uses [peribolos](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/cmd/peribolos) to manage the org configuration.

Changes to this configuration are applied automatically via a [GitHub action](.github/workflows/peribolos.yaml).

## Requirements

Feel free to open issues, comment, open pull requests or propose designs whether you are a member of the `kloops-io` org or not!
